# OCR-Epita


OCR is a 2nd year project at EPITA carried out in groups of 4. The goal is to create a software that allows you to solve a sudoku from an image.

It is composed of two major parts, the first is the detection of the grid and the sudoku boxes. The second is the use of artificial intelligence to determine the value of the number in the box.

Thanks to this, we can solve to display the solved sudoku.
